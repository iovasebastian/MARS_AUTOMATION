# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The Mars Habitat Automation Platform is a distributed, event-driven system. It allows operators to monitor and control the base's status via the system dashboard and console.
The system dashboard displays various environmental data received from sensors in real time. Operators may control base actuators via the console and edit base automation rules.

# USER STORIES:

1) As a Habitat Operator, I want to view all active sensors and their latest readings on a unified dashboard, so that I can monitor the overall habitat environment at a glance.
2) As a Habitat Operator, I want the sensor data on my dashboard to update automatically in real-time, so that I always have the most current telemetry without needing to refresh the page.
3) As a Habitat Operator, I want to see specific measurement units (e.g., °C, kW, L/min) displayed alongside sensor values, so that I can interpret the data correctly.
4) As a Habitat Operator, I want data from both slow-polling sensors and high-speed telemetry streams to be displayed in the same consistent format, so that I don't have to use different tools for different devices.
5) As a Habitat Operator, I want new sensors to be automatically discovered and integrated into my monitoring view, so that I don't have to manually configure the system every time a new device is wired up.
6) As a Habitat Operator, I want to clearly see the current operational state (ON/OFF) of all habitat actuators (e.g., cooling fans, heaters), so that I know exactly what life-support equipment is currently running.
7) As a Habitat Operator, I want to manually toggle the state of any actuator directly from the dashboard, so that I can immediately intervene and override the system during an emergency.
8) As a Habitat Operator, I want my manual actuator changes to be instantly reflected on the UI, so that I have immediate visual feedback that my command was executed.
9) As a Habitat Operator, I want the system to automatically turn actuators ON or OFF based on environmental data, so that the habitat remains safe even while I am sleeping.
10) As a Habitat Operator, I want to create new automation rules through a visual interface on the dashboard, so that I can quickly instruct the system how to react to new environmental threats.
11) As a Habitat Operator, I want to configure rule conditions using standard mathematical comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `=`, `>`, `>=`), so that I can set precise safety thresholds (e.g., trigger fan if temp > 28°C).
12) As a Habitat Operator, I want to view a list of all currently active automation rules, so that I know exactly how the system is programmed to behave.
13) As a Habitat Operator, I want to edit existing automation rules, so that I can adjust safety thresholds as the mission parameters or seasons change.
14) As a Habitat Operator, I want to delete obsolete automation rules, so that they don't trigger unwanted or conflicting system behaviors.
15) As a Habitat Operator, I want the automation service to log every time an automation rule automatically triggers an actuator to the console output, so that I can trace the system's autonomous decisions via container logs.
16) As a Platform Administrator, I want to deploy the entire habitat automation platform using a single startup command (`docker compose up`), so that recovery time is minimized during critical system failures.
17) As a Platform Administrator, I want the system's internal communication to use a resilient message broker, so that sudden spikes in sensor data do not overwhelm the processing engines.
18) As a Platform Administrator, I want the data ingestion, rule evaluation, and web interface to run as separate isolated microservices, so that a crash in the web UI does not stop the background automation engine from keeping the crew alive.
19) As a Platform Administrator, I want all defined automation rules to be saved to a persistent database, so that critical safety logic is immediately restored without manual data entry after a system reboot.
20) As a Platform Administrator, I want the platform to automatically normalize all heterogeneous device payloads into a single standard event format internally, so that future developers can add new features without worrying about device-specific dialects.


# CONTAINERS:

## CONTAINER_NAME: ingestion-service

### DESCRIPTION:
Discovers simulator sensors, polls REST sensor endpoints, consumes telemetry WebSocket streams, normalizes heterogeneous payloads, and publishes normalized events to RabbitMQ.

### PORTS:
No external port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (container exposes 8001 internally only).

### DESCRIPTION:
Ingestion service runs as a background producer: discovers sensors, polls REST endpoints, listens to telemetry WebSockets, normalizes payloads, and publishes events to RabbitMQ. It does not expose business APIs.

### PERSISTANCE EVALUATION
No persistence required. Service is stateless and forwards normalized events.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- RabbitMQ: `amqp://guest:guest@broker:5672/`

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: ingestion-be
